Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station, find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.
We are given two arrays which represent arrival and departure times of trains that stop

Examples:

Input:  arr[]  = {9:00,  9:40, 9:50,  11:00, 15:00, 18:00}
        dep[]  = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}
Output: 3
There are at-most three trains at a time (time between 11:00 to 11:20)
*/
int findPlatform(int arr[], int dep[], int n)
{
   // Sort arrival and departure arrays
   sort(arr, arr+n);
   sort(dep, dep+n);
 
   // plat_needed indicates number of platforms needed at a time
   int plat_needed = 1, result = 1;
   int i = 1, j = 0;
 
   // Similar to merge in merge sort to process all events in sorted order
   while (i < n && j < n)
   {
      // If next event in sorted order is arrival, increment count of
      // platforms needed
      if (arr[i] < dep[j])
      {
          plat_needed++;
          i++;
          if (plat_needed > result)  // Update result if needed
              result = plat_needed;
      }
      else // Else decrement count of platforms needed
      {
          plat_needed--;
          j++;
      }
   }
 
   return result;
}
